Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for building web services. REST requests are made over HTTP using the same HTTP verbs that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to servers. The verbs are:

    GET – this operation is used to retrieve data from the web service.
    POST – this operation is used to create a new item of data on the web service.
    PUT – this operation is used to update an item of data on the web service.
    PATCH – this operation is used to update an item of data on the web service by describing a set of instructions about how the item should be modified. This verb is not used in the sample application.
    DELETE – this operation is used to delete an item of data on the web service.

Web service APIs that adhere to REST are called RESTful APIs, and are defined using:

    A base URI.
    HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE.
    A media type for the data, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML.
