 1. NAMESPACES 
   + Allow structure for our code. Namespaces can be nested so having a namespace contain another namespace
     but also contain classes, interfaces, delegates. 

   + A class can be used in multiple namespaces. 
   
2. CLASSES
   + A class represents a custom data type. In C#, the class defines the kinds of information and methods
   included in a custom type.

   + When used in various areas of a program a class will be instantiated or an object will be created. 

   + A class will take fields as class members which have a default value (e.g boolean by default is false)

   + Each Class Field has a Property which validates what values are set to a specific Field using get() and set()
