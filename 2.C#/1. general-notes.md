### 1. NAMESPACES    
 - Allow structure for our code. Namespaces can be nested so having a namespace contain another namespace
    but also contain classes, interfaces, delegates.    
 - A class can be used in multiple namespaces 
   
### 2. CLASSES   
 - A class represents a custom data type. In C#, the class defines the kinds of information and methods
   included in a custom type.   
 - When used in various areas of a program a class will be instantiated or an object will be created.    
 - A class will take fields as class members which have a default value (e.g boolean by default is false)   
 - Each Class Field has a Property which validates what values are set to a specific Field using get() and set()   
    ```a get() method, or getter: called when the property is accessed```   
    ```a set() method, or setter: called when the property is assigned a value```   

    ```C# Forest f = new Forest();
    f.Area = -1; // set() is called
    Console.WriteLine(f.Area); // get() is called; prints -1```
- Name a property with the title-cased version of its field’s name, e.g. age and Age, name and Name   
- public — a public member can be accessed by any class   
  private — a private member can only be accessed by code in the same class


### 3. If we want programs to get the value of the property, but we don’t want programs to set the value of the property. Then we can:   
    - not include a set() method, or    
    - make the set() method private.
